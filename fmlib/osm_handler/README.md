## Requirements
Since pyproj has other binary dependencies, it is not included in the requirements.txt file by default.
This is to avoid issues with installing packages for zappa deployment.
Add following to your project requirements.txt if you want to use this module.
```
-r /fmlib/osm_handler/requirements.txt
```
